### The Background

JBS International contracted Kinetic Co-Founder Chris McGrath to act as a Sr. Drupal Developer to support the Vista Campus [vistacampus.gov](http://vistacampus.gov/), a project of the [Corporation for National and Community Service](https://www.nationalservice.gov/) (CNCS). The site is aimed at helping members of the VISTA program connect, collaborate and take advantage of the many resources available to them through CNCS. Chris worked in conjunction with [Phase 2 Technology](https://www.phase2technology.com/), the original vendor, to maintain and enhance the flagship property of the Americore Vista program for a period of 6 months.

The site was originally built in Drupal 7 by Portland based Drupal development firm Open Sourcery, who has since been acquired by Phase 2. The site was one of the most complicated ever built by Open Sourcery, according to lead developer on the project, and Drupal community guru [Jonathan Hedstrom ](https://www.drupal.org/u/jhedstrom).
