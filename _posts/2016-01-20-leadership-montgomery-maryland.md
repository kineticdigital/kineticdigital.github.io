Leadership Montgomery (LMMD) is a 25 year old non-profit organization in Maryland that seeks to instill leadership skills in its program participants and graduates. Their programs are aimed at age groups that range from Teens to Seniors. Graduates include major CEO's and high ranking government officials in the region who consider the programs an invaluable asset to the community.

Kinetic helped to redesign and update LMMD's website converting it from Drupal 6 to 7 and providing a visual redesign. All on a short 3-month timeline which also kept the budget in check. We also provide ongoing support to keep the website and membership of 3,000 secure as well as providing enhancements as needed. We also keep the organization informed on the evolution of Drupal and what impacts that will have on the product.
